/*

We have decided to utilize a common pattern when using Go channels, in order to create a 2-tier channel system,
one for queuing jobs and another to control how many workers operate on the JobQueue concurrently.
The idea was to parallelize the creating movie to mongo to a somewhat sustainable rate,
one that would not cripple the machine nor start generating connections errors from mongo.
So we have opted for creating a Job/Worker pattern.

For those that are familiar with Java, C#, etc, think about this as the Golang way of implementing
a Worker Thread-Pool utilizing channels instead.
